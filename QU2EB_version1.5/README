version1.2

- Works only for the case of clean CMB.
- Not robust against foregrounds.
- Might work if the foregrounds are far from the edges of the mask.

version1.3

- Works even for the case of dirty CMB.
- Constructed such that the estimation is very robust against the values of the map in the masked regions.
- Works equally well for clean as well and foreground added (+ masked) CMB maps.

version1.3a

- This is a minimalized version of version1.3.
- Unlike version1.3 where the code generates the apodized mask, the polarization data etc. etc., this version of the code is minimal in the sense that it takes Q/U and mask (in apodized form) as input and returns the reconstructed E/B maps.
- Takes data in format TQU.

version1.4

- The major upgrade here is the capability to work on a set of simulations.
- Changes made to :
     > allocate_data()
     > write_data()
==> NEEDS TO BE TESTED TO ENSURE THAT THE CHANGES HAVENT INTRODUCED ANY BUGS.

version1.5
- The monopole dipole removal causes for some feature to appear at the poles of the E-mode map. Commented out the monopole dipole removal lines of code.
- Also map to alm routine in all places written in a manner such that one can easily change between the map2alm_iterative and map2alm routine.
- The code now does either full sky or the masked sky analysis depending on the switch swDOFS. Unlike before where it did both if swDOFS=.True.
